Data Sources:

The Romanian CUI/CIF validation algorithm is based on:
- Romanian Tax Code (Codul Fiscal al României)
- ANAF (Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală) specifications
- Official Romanian government regulations

ANAF API Integration:
This software integrates with the ANAF (Romanian National Agency for 
Fiscal Administration) public TVA REST API to query company tax 
information. The API endpoint and data structures are based on official 
ANAF documentation.

CUI/CIF Validation:
The validation algorithm implements the official Romanian checksum 
calculation as specified by ANAF for validating Cod Unic de Identificare 
(CUI) and Cod de Identificare Fiscală (CIF) numbers.
